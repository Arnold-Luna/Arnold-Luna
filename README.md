# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Hands-on cybersecurity + cloud security labs focused on **SOC workflows, incident response, threat detection, vulnerability management, and system hardening**.  

Everything here is built to be **repeatable**, **documented**, and **reviewable** (screenshots, configs, commands, findings).

## 📂 What’s Inside 

### Incident Response
- IR notes, triage workflows, evidence handling, and documented investigations  
- Artifacts: timelines, indicators, root cause, lessons learned

### Cloud Projects (AWS)
- IAM, logging/monitoring, secure networking (VPC), least privilege, audit trails  
- Focus: “secure-by-default” infrastructure patterns

### Endpoint Security
- Hardening steps, detection logic, host-based telemetry, baseline configs  
- Focus: reduce attack surface + catch weird behavior early

### Network Defense
- Scanning, segmentation concepts, firewall/ACL logic, traffic analysis  
- Focus: enforce controls and validate them with testing

### Threat Analysis
- IOC analysis, attacker techniques, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Focus: explain what happened in normal human language

### Vulnerability Management
- Finding → risk rating → remediation → verification  
- Focus: prioritize what actually reduces risk

## 🧪 Project Format 
Most folders follow a structure like:
- **README.md** (overview + objective)
- **steps/** (exact commands + procedure)
- **findings/** (screenshots + outputs)
- **notes/** (why it matters + lessons learned)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Incident response process, triage, basic forensics mindset
- Log analysis / detection fundamentals
- Network scanning & validation (e.g., Nmap)
- IAM, least privilege, cloud logging concepts
- Vulnerability lifecycle: identify → assess → mitigate → verify
- Documentation that someone else can reproduce

  Evidence-based review of email security posture with screenshots + recommendations.

- **AWS Logging & Monitoring Setup**  
  Built baseline logging and auditing posture, validated events, documented findings.

- **Network Recon & Service Enumeration Lab**  
  Ran controlled scans, interpreted results, mapped risk, proposed mitigations.
